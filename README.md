## App Description
This project aims to create a social media experience unlike any other.
Using a graphic user interface, users will be able to create a custom sound form and arrange it in a series of selected notes,
Then, an interactive canvas element will generate shapes that will play through the selected notes in a semi-randomized fashion via collision detection.

Users can then share these creations with people they follow.
